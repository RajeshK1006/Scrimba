# Newsletter Form Project

This project is a simple newsletter signup form that I created using HTML and CSS. I designed it based on an example from W3Schools and deployed it using Netlify.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the content of the form.
- **CSS**: For styling the form, with a focus on the box model and Flexbox for layout.
- **Netlify**: For deploying the finished project.

## What I Learned

### HTML

- Basic structure of an HTML document.
- Creating and using form elements (`<input>`, `<label>`, `<button>`).
- Accessibility practices, such as using `for` attributes on labels to associate them with form controls.

### CSS

- **Box Model**: Understanding how padding, border, and margin affect the layout and size of elements.
- **Flexbox**: Using Flexbox for creating responsive and flexible layouts.
  - `display: flex;` for parent containers.
  - Flex properties like `justify-content`, `align-items`, and `flex-direction`.

### Deployment

- Using Netlify to deploy static websites.
- Steps to connect a repository to Netlify for automatic deployment.
